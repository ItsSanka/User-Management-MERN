User Management System - MERN Stack
Jun 2024 - Sep 2024
I developed a User Management System, a web-based application that streamlines user data management within various organizational structures. The system supports multiple user roles and features secure authentication and customized CRUD operations for each role. This project was designed with scalability, data security, and a user-friendly interface, ensuring an efficient platform for managing users across different use cases, such as e-commerce, learning management systems (LMS), and healthcare applications.

Key Features:

Centralized platform for user roles and permissions
Secure authentication protocols
Intuitive, role-specific CRUD operations
Scalable architecture for growing data management
Frontend: React.js, React-Bootstrap | Backend: Node.js, Express.js | Database: MongoDB
This project demonstrates my ability to design and implement complex systems with a focus on performance, security, and user experience.
